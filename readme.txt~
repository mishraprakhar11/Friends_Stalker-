Hello guys,
    This is the script I wrote to notify you whenever your friend makes a submission on codeforces
    in real time. I have already written a blog about it in codeforces.com, you can find it here :
    
    http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/21398
    
    ***In the Friends_Stalker! folder their are 4 other files excluding readme.txt:
    
    1- codeforces.py : This file works on both (Linux-based/Windows) OS. It opens a dialog box to
    notify and requires you to close it.
    
    2- codeforces(Linux).py: This script has a feature to open a notification like pop-up which
    will go away automatically after sometime. You dont have to close it! Works only in Linux
    based OS.
    
    3- codeforces(windows).py: This script has a feature to open a notification like pop-up which
    will go away automatically after sometime. You dont have to close it! Works only in windows OS.
    
    4- friends.txt: In this file you have to copy-paste the handles of your friends separateed with
     spaces. Make sure they have the exact same spelling as codeforces.
    
    
    
    ***You can run the script by going into Friends-Stalker! directory through terminal/cmd and 
    running command -
    
    python codeforces.py friends.txt
                or
    python codeforces(Linux).py friends.txt
                or
    python codeforces(windows).py friends.txt
    
    
     
    Read the codeforces blog as well since it provide a detailed explaination of script.
    Cheers!
